The programs use statistics from 100 cities to predict crime rates using tensorflow.
The target values are taken from the first column and replaced with 1's to add bias to the dataset.
The primary difference in the programs is how the calculations of the weights (w) are done. One program utilizes
linear regression, and the other uses ridge regression to train the program. The programs output the predicted values (y) and optimal wight vector (w)
